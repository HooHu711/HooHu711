 <p> 
 The gaming world is a complex place with competition building up everywhere.
Places like youtube have many famous celebrities that enjoy playing these digital entertainment, but since GAMING has been around for a huge period of time, beginners are slapped on the face with offensive vocabulary to show the hatred of the, commonly known 'Noobs'</p>

<p> 
Hi, I am the guy that you want to listen to right now or else, you will suffer the pain of getting bankrupt while betting with your friends. Yes if your reading this right now than your a NOOB. But, please don't worry because after you take about 30 minutes reading this, you will be less distant from your future goal of being like an average gamer.

<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>Pokemon</li>
<li>e.t.c</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p> BUT no one has the right to judge you for the games you play, because as may people know no one can be the same, even if Adolf Hitler had a clone, both of them will be different. their moustache might have a different number of individual hair, but most importantly their spirits will not be the same, just like every one of us.</p>
<br>
 <p>It's just that the world is not humble enough that they judge other people rather than judging themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>We just need to remember that we shouldn't be dissapointed in ourselves for being different, just because we have a unique gaming choice, we just need to own up to it. instead we can just....... </p>
